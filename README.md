# Retailytics-Pro
This project is an end-to-end sales prediction system built using Streamlit for the UI, Flask for backend API integration, and scikit-learn for machine learning. It leverages a trained regression model and an encoder (saved as .pkl files) to predict sales based on various product and store attributes.
